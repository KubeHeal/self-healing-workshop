== Getting Help

If you encounter issues during the workshop:

. Check the **Troubleshooting** sections in each module
. Ask your instructor
. Review the https://github.com/KubeHeal/openshift-aiops-platform/blob/main/docs/guides/TROUBLESHOOTING-GUIDE.md[Troubleshooting Guide]

== Let's Get Started!

When you're ready, proceed to xref:module-00.adoc[Module 0: Introduction & Architecture] to learn how the platform works before diving into hands-on exercises.

[NOTE]
====
**Architecture Note**: The MCP Server and Coordination Engine are **Go services** for production performance. The Jupyter notebooks are **Python** for ML/data science. You don't need to write Go code to use the platform!
